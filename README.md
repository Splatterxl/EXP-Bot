## How to Use

</div>

First, you need to fill in all of the values in [`config.json`](/config.json). Most of these values require Discord Snowflakes. If you fon't know how to get those, check [this guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-).

```js
{
  "logChannelID": "", // channel where ban/kick/mute/kick alerts will be sent
  "token": "", // your bot token (in the application dashboard)
  "permissions": { // each command accepts role IDs for who can use them
    "addcookies": [], // if an array is empty, anyone can use it
    "balance": [], // for example:
    "ban": ["adminRoleID", "otherRoleID", "lastRoleID"],
    "clearallwarnings": [],
    "clearwarnings": [],
    "eat": [], // put in as many or as little roles as you want
    "exp": [],
    "kick": [],
    "leaderboard": [],
    "moderate": [],
    "purge": [],
    "subcookies": [],
    "warn": [],
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

You're basically all set! This bot works out of the box thanks to the JSON file databases.
